Some quick sketches trying to figure out another character from The Calling, which I began to describe here: [The Mage](/posts/mage)

Her name is Inéz:

![Inéz](/images/the-calling/inez.jpg) 

This older woman is a cowboy who has lost an eye and she is dismissed by all of these new younger cowboys because she is getting older and after the accident in which she lost her eye people thought she had lost her talent too. 

She has seen many of her friends and new cowboys die due to their foolishness. People who were once full of life and vibrant are in the ground.

She used to work with a group of cowboys who were her friends. She was a rude person and a little mean, but they softened her.

“People who were once full of life, funny vibrant things. Died to their foolishness. Eclipsed in the dirt by my hands”

Some creature or thing has been destroying houses and killing anything it percieves to be a child. 

The way the town, under this magical seige caused by The Calling, is set up that there are cowboys who protect the town.  There is a hierarchy and gate privileges where some are allowed out to fight the creatures.  Perhaps due to the others dismissing her, or perhaps she was too ornery to the the wrong cowboy, but she has lost her privileges and cannot help the town in this time of grave danger.  

Young cowboys are gearing up to go and fight it and she thinks they are going to get themselves killed.  She is not a coward, but she is not a fool either.  She has seen too many people die.  She is not going to let herself be one of them, nor let these young pups get slaughtered - she can sense that the danger is greater than they know.  She is going to do something about it.

As she is spying on the cowboys trying to figure out what is happening a young boy approaches her.

He asks her if she was a real cowboy, she corrects him saying that she is a real cowboy.

He talks about seeing things that others can’t and how the air has been bad recently and none of the other cowboys will listen to him and how he is even better than them because he can sneak into their office without anyone noticing– 

She stops him.  What an annoying child.  But is he speaking about his own imaginings or does he actually see magical creatures.  If so that would be quite rare, indeed.  And he's probably made no friends with his sneaking ways.  

But he might be useful.  

She asks him if he could get something without being noticed.

Yes ma'am.

She tells him that they can make a deal: if he can get the gate key and sneak her out at night to kill the creature before other people get hurt, he can hide far away and watch.

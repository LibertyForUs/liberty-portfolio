This is a goblin general from a dnd game that I am making.
Her full name is Relne “bug bite” Ruckus.
She is the chief commander of the goblin army and her brother is the king.
She is named bug bite because she fought against fairies in the war she started to get goblins allowed back in the feywild. She was motivated by the fact that goblins got killed every day by humans back on the material plane (its the place where most dnd campaigns take place in like a magical area where humans and a bunch of other kinds of creatures and people live) while fairies and other magical creatures got to live very well in a place called the feywild. Goblins were kicked out of the feywild a long time ago so she wanted back in. Her and her brother planned for years to be able to take them down and eventually succeeded. 


The 3D model is based off of of her and is a modified copy of the first realistic head I tried to 3D model.

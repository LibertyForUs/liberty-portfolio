 ![Big Guy](/images/big-guy.png Big guy) Big guy is a monster I created while making my Revolver game.
He was going to be a boss monster, but then me and my partner ran out of time. 
He was going to first be encountered as almost eating a hated character in the game. And the player having the chance to stop the monster. The annoying guy would be calling for help as the monster slept with the guy in his hand.

The monster would have four arms. The arms had a bow, a hammer, the guy, and a free hand. 
The bow and hammer could be used to attack while the free hand assisted in these actions (the free hand getting an arrow for the bow or helping hold the hammer since itâ€™s two-handed). 
The hand with the guy could be used to trick the player by making the player attack the guy instead.


The Big Guy could also have a special move where he combined the Hammer and the bow.

For the Revolver game we created a [dump document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wMpDqfrAKboO1mxt-QLrn8BP_GyFN6_At6cSSMzqPFU/edit# "dump document") to get all of our ideas down on paper. We then referred to this to to collaborate.  Writing ideas down is key when collaborating so that the ideas are clear.  You can also literally point to a spceific thought and all the related stuff around it can be seen by the other people on your team without you having to explain it all.  This is also helpful when you aren't meeting in person and working on your own time.

![The Sigil](/images/sigil.jpg) 

A cused witch casts a dark sigil.  I drew the hand as a sketch, imported the sketch into Blender.  Then I modeled the hand against the sketch.  I then exported the image and in Procreate on the iPad I drew a form fitting texture for the hand.  I brought that texture back into Blender and mapped it onto the hand.  I then did a sketch of the sigil and in Blender converted to grease pencil.  I lit the scene against a cyclorama and captured the current state for this.  Having so much fun!

The Music game is set in the far future after humans have gone extinct and aliens have taken over earth. All humans went extinct in the 1930s due to an “alien shipping accident” which was actually a cover up for the alien government to destroy humans because they thought that humans were getting too powerful because they understood math and were about to understand the secrets to alien magic, the record. 

The main character is a half-casset, half-mockingbird alien who goes to a musical temple that was built on earth to play a song to get her parents to stop fighting. 
The thing is, she cannot play an instrument because she has flimsy tape for arms, and cannot speak on her own because she does not have a mouth.

What she does have is the ability to play back sounds that she has heard.

The game mechanic is going through musical puzzles in this musical temple, while only being able to make sounds by repeating the sounds of others.

Other lore stuff:

There is a religion where people believe that if they can map out the entire universe they can map out the song of the universe and then play it to understand the meaning of life.
This religion ended up creating the biggest spacer agency in the galaxy due to the religion being able to amass funds in one spot and their single drive to map out the universe.

This mushroom man aka morel is a NPC in the music game who is studying the music temple.
He is married to Pok who is also studying the temple and is kinda the tutorial guy

The 3D model is not at all game-ready and was mostly made just to show what the mushroom man could look like in 3D.

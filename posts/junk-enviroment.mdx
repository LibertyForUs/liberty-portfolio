I was given an assignment by by 2D art class to design and create concept art for an enviroment. I started with an Idea I had as a kid of a world that was full of people made of things you could find in a junk drawer.
In this world, although they were made of objects that once were lifeless, they were given life by a magical spider that lived within the drawer. The silk of this spider, once woven into inanimate objects, blesses those objects with life.

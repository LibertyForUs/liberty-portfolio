title: Concept Art - Junk Drawer World
description: "Enviroment Assignment"

I was given an assignment by by 2D art class to design and create concept art for an enviroment. I started with an Idea I had as a kid of a world that was full of people made of things you could find in a junk drawer.
In this world, although they were made of objects that once were lifeless, they were given life by a magical spider that lived within the drawer. The silk of this spider, once woven into inanimate objects, blesses those objects with life. However, overtime this blessing fades, the string losing its potency eventually causing the death of whoever it once gave life to. 
Some people worship the spider as a godess of sorts, building temples and shrines to her calling her by her divine name of Akrana. 
This was once of the original sketches I made back then:

I revisited this idea for this enviroment project because back then I didn't really have an enviroment in mind. I began making sketches to try and give myself some ideas. 
I wanted to showcase some lore of the world in my image. So I started by sketching out different ideas. Some of these ideas include: a shrine for Akrana with broken CD that was shaped into her image, a series of popsicle-stick steps on the side of a cliffside leading to an ancient temple, and a sphere made of bottle caps. I'm not sure why, but the bottle sphere intrigued me. At first I thought of it being a spaceship, but that felt to advanced for this world. So I instead transformed it into a turret.

My idea for the turret was that there were thick layers of popsicle sticks as a base which then had a bottle cap roof on top as a way to spread out the impact of any forces hitting the turret. A glass bottle attached to the roof acts as a shell for the canon. The bottle can be pivoted as the bottle caps are not connected to eachother but rather

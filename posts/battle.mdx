![Battle of the Heart](/images/battle/town-background.png) was a game I made with three other students as the main assignment for the USC Summer Program Game Design course in 2023.  

I signed up to be the Producer for the game and found it really challenging.  One issue with course assignements is that there is no established hierarchy determining whose vision determines what will be made.  This was really hard for me!  First, it was difficult to negotiate a clear and successful vision. Secondly I had an opinion that we were taking on too much and woudl not be able to complete what we were attempting.  I advocated for a more focused effort.   While we finished the game sufficient to get an A in the class, I felt like we could have made a much better game if I had been able to better align us around a cohesive vision and schedule.  This was a really valuable lesson and my appreciation for producers is huge.

Having said that, I'm proud of the work I did.

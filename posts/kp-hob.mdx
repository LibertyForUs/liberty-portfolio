Here is my experiment creating a character I love - Captain (now Major) [K.P. Hob](https://dimension20.fandom.com/wiki/Major_K._P._Hob) from the Dimension20 D&D game A Court of Fey & Flowers.

Here is my first draft in Belnder:

 <figcaption align = "center"><b>K.P. Hob sketched up</b></figcaption>

And here he is with some test colors:

 <figcaption align = "center"><b>K.P. Hob color</b></figcaption>

...and with lighting!

 <figcaption align = "center"><b>K.P. Hob _lit_</b></figcaption>

 I love him, love the campaign.  I was inspired for one of my own campaigns by this one.

Here is my experiment creating a character I love - Captain (now Major) [K.P. Hob](https://dimension20.fandom.com/wiki/Major_K._P._Hob) from the Dimension20 D&D game A Court of Fey & Flowers.

Here is my first draft in Belnder:

And here he is with some test colors:

...and with lighting!

 <figcaption align = "center"><b>K.P. Hob _lit_</b></figcaption>

Redid the textures and added tasselly epaulettes.  In the background you can see the sketch I made that I started from.  I pull my sketches into blender and it allows me to use them as a visual guide while I build the 3d form.

Reshaped the face and eyes, changed the lighting added the tusksand added a good background for lighting.

 I love him, love the campaign.  I was inspired for one of my own campaigns by this one.

![The Devil](/images/mage.jpg) One of my favorite things to do is worldbuilding.  

Here is a image I built in Procreate.  He is a mage being seduced by a sort of a demon.  This is during an event where an ancient eldritch endless one beneath a mountain has called all living creatures to come.  This is sort of a mass spell that living beings aren't really aware of, they feel they must come.  Given our psychology, humans are inventing reasons to go, thinking that they decided on their own.  It is a sort of mass psychosis, but one created in response to a signal with a specific purpose - to attract living beings to the mountain so that the waking creature there may consume them.  
 
I should probably explain: this is a universe where magic exists and is known to humans and is practiced by them.  But it's vert rare.  Unseen.  Many humans belive it is myth or madness.  
 
At the calling from the mountain, all living beings are called, creating a regional catastrophy of sorts.  In the area around the mountain a zone of increased magic energy has formed.  Part of this is a consequence of the actions of the ancient and nameless being under the mountain.  Part of this is a secondary effect as magical creatures are especially subject to "the call".  

Here a sort of demon is using its attack of seduction.  A human subject to the attack will become entranced and amazed and will fall into the thrall of the casting demon.  The subject of the attack is our mage.  Is he in danger and doesn't know it?  Is he a thousand years old and has seen this all before, and finds it amusing that this sweet creature thinks it will devour him?  The viewer of this image does not know yet.

Part of the story arc here is that humans are called, go into the zone and are beset with demons like this.  Also in the areas around the zone, more of these attacks are happening.  It turns out that these "demons" are not mortal enemies of humans.  Its just what is happening, sort of as a natural accident, upon this rare contact between species that generally exist on different planes of existence.  Here the nameless evil under the mountain is blending dimensions into one sphere around the mountain, and this is forcing creatures from different planes to contend with eachother in ways that they aren't evolutionarily prepared for.  Later on, humans figure out that these "demons" aren't their enemy and sone tenuous alliances form, which are helpful in the coming war against the horror that lies below.

![The Mage](/images/the-calling/mage.jpg) 

One of my favorite things to do is worldbuilding.  I'm working on a world, and this image I built in Procreate is for an ideation in that world.He is a mage being seduced by a sort of a demon.  
 
This scene is happening in a universe where magic exists and is known to humans and is practiced by them, but it's vert rare.  Generally in the shadows, and unseen.  Many humans belive it is myth or madness.  

The mage has been brought to this land where demons like this one are suddenly active.  It is during an event where an ancient eldritch endless one beneath a mountain has called all living creatures to come by ementating a frequency or an incantation of a continent-sized spell that living beings aren't really aware of.  For a thousand miles, humans as well as creatures great and small, feel they must come.  Given our psychology, humans are inventing reasons to go, thinking that they decided on their own.  It is a sort of mass psychosis, but one created in response to a signal with a specific purpose - to attract living beings to the mountain so that the waking creature there may consume them.  
 
At the calling from the mountain, all living beings are called, creating a regional catastrophy.  In the area around the mountain a zone of increased magic energy has formed, due to the forces emenating from the nameless one under the mountain.   A secondary effect is that magical creatures, such as this demon, are especially subject to "the call".  

Here this demon is using its attack of a form of seduction, like a Greek Siren.  A human subject to the attack will become entranced and amazed and will fall into the thrall of the casting demon.  The subject of the attack is our mage.  Is he in danger and doesn't know it?  Is he a thousand years old and has seen this all before, and finds it amusing that this sweet creature thinks it will devour him?  The viewer of this image does not know yet.

This is in the first act of a story arc.  Humans are called, and this mage was quick to respond as has a studied awareness that picked up the "pre quake" early emenations.  He responded and upon arrival in The Zone has come upon this demon which proceedes with its entrancement.  This is happening all over to humans who have no knowledge or magical ability, in and near The Zone.      

At the end of Act One we learn that these "demons" are not the mortal enemies of humans.  These attacks are what is happening as natural accident: rare contact between species that generally exist on different planes of existence and are prone to their own natural defences in the face of potential threats - which each view eachother to be.  Th nameless evil under the mountain has blended dimensions into one sphere around the mountain, and this is forcing creatures from different planes to contend with eachother in ways that they aren't evolutionarily prepared for.  

Later on, humans figure out that these "demons" aren't their enemy and sone tenuous alliances form, which are helpful in the coming war against the horror that lies below.

![The Cowboy](/images/cowboy/alien-cowboy-shirt.jpg) 

This is an alien who has crashed on earth right into the wild west. He was young when he crashed but was raised by a gang of cowboys. He was able to disguise his alien appearance through his chameleon like abilities, but here is is true face and some fancy western wear. He is the main character of a comic i am working on.

Hi!

I'm Liberty, and I make games.  I am growing my skill at storytelling, world building, 3D rendering, 2D concept art, character design.

I've worked on three games, two of which have game play videos here: [spirit gun](/posts/revolver) (aka Revolver), and [face your fears](/posts/face-your-fears).

I'm fascinated by story, interesting game mechanics, and combining narrative and interactivity in ways that empower the player but also allow them to learn about the game maker.

I'm currently working on a game called "The Call" which is a story about a world where magic exists, and an ancient evil under a mountain that is calling to it all living creatures across half a continent

The game is about the journey of a [mage](/posts/mage) who is called to the mountain and also that of a demon, also impelled by "The Call".


Examples of 3D rendering:
- [KP Hob](/posts/kp-hob) fan art 
- [the devil](/posts/devil) as a middle aged man, full of regret (includes some story concepting)
- [different](/posts/blender-alien-fish) [types](/posts/blender-alien-man) of [aliens](/posts/blender-alien-deer)


Concept and character art:
- [In√©z](/posts/inez) a badass and severely underestimated cowgirl
- [Cassette Girl](/posts/music-game) from a music-oriented game I am working on 
- [characters](/posts/dungeons-and-dragons) from [D&D](/posts/dungeons-and-dragons-bug-bite) games I have DMed
- [big guy](/posts/big-guy)  from [spirit gun](/posts/revolver)

Production assets
- [textures and walk cycles](/posts/revolver-assets) from [spirit gun](/posts/revolver) (aka Revolver)
- the [dump document](/posts/dump-document) for spirit gun 
- my first attempt at a [walk cycle](/posts/walking-animation)

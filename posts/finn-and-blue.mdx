Over the summer of my Junior year, I was privileged to take USC's CTAN-330 Animation Fundamentals class. It was a great experience, and I learned a lot about the animation process.  

We did many studies; I'll post some later.

My work culminated in a final project, the video short "Finn is Hungry." 

There are a few moments of audio dialogue.

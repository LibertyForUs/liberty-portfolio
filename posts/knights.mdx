In the summer of 2020 - when I was in between my freshman and sophomore years - I worked with three college students on a game.  I learned many things about game making but mostly I learned about working with others and expressing myself.  Prior to this I was pretty shy and introverted, but in making this game design, I learned how to speak up and how important it is to share my vision.  I also learned about team dynamics and project management as the team went around in circles on their ideas.

The game was to be isometric 16 bit.

Here is a blacksmith I really loved.

      />


Here she is Coupa, one of the knights.

      />

Coupa was one of my first walk cycles.  Figuring out how to work with Aseprite brought me joy.

Face Your Fears aka Occultatum is a game where you are a creature - thousands of years old - who is root-borne.  You exist better under the ground than you do above it and can switch between effortlessly.  You can grow your root-like arms to any length to grab or place objects.  

Above ground, you exist among humans and strive to stay undetected by them. For this, you wear a hoodie.

You have a special power and that is you can see people's fears.  These show up as scary giant shadowy creatures that live above the people who they haunt.

Ocultatum - our hero - has a mission: to remain undetected by humans but to help those with fears to overcome them.  To do this, Ocultatum must find the fears and destroy them, while comforting the people that the fears are tormenting.  This gives the game a split-action feel.  "OC" This is done by grabbing the fears and placing them in a hole in the ground.  The hole is a portal to the underworld where the fears live.  Once the fears are destroyed, the people are free of them and can live a normal life, and OC can advance to the next level.

OC's skills:
1. Can move above and under ground
2. Can grow his arms to any length and pick up objects, then carry them
3. Can see people's fears
4. Can destroy fears (varies by fear)
5. Can comfort people (varies by person)
6. Beloved by dogs 

In this clip you can see OC move around in a parallax, hand drawn world.  There is some depth, and the ability to flip under ground.  You can see OC pick up and drop a dog.  There is object detection, clouds that go in front of the sun with translucence.  Unfinished but I hope you can feel the vibe we were trying to create.

For my art class our final assignment was to take an already existing tale and reimagine the characters and enviroment within it.
We chose the myth of the Zodica Race and I reworked the character of the cat.
In certain versions of the Myth The cat is pushed into the water by the rat who wants to come in first place. This is the version we used. 
We reimagined the Zodiac race as a street race taking place in a cyberpunk-esque future where animal people race in underground leagues for an attempt to join human racers in the premier leagues.



First I started with doing some ideating without using reference to try and let myself explore who the cat could be. 
I started out with this grey sleek cat, with his whiskers forming a mustache. Originally going with the idea of the cat being this suave character that humanoid cats are usually depicted as.
Then I thought it would be funny to go in an opposite direction of making this large fluffy orange cat and I knew this was closer to what I wanted. Imagining the Zodiac race concept to be a real story, I realized making the cat fluffy was the right decision. 
If there was going to be a scene where The Cat is shoved into the water by The Mouse, like in the version of the tale we were going off of, making The Cat very fluffy would be able to exaggerate the betrayal in that scene by making him literally shrink when he falls into the water.
If I made him sleeker then this wouldn't seem as big of a difference.

I then found some references for The Cat that I could use for further ideating. I not only wanted to find images of cats that I could use to better find what The Cat would look like, but I also wanted to find some that showed personality that I could use to imbue life into The Cat.

With these reference photos I began to really figure out the shape of The Cat by making some silhouettes. I originally was going to have The Cat's vehicle be a motorcycle as when I was first ideating it made sense to give a sleek cat a sleek vehicle that might allow him to squeeze through different gaps in the city in a way that other vehicles couldn't. 
Then as I started to develop the personality of the cat better in my head as a part of a story I realized a few things. One, the cat had to be both relatable and well liked to make the betrayal of the rat feel much more impactful later to the viewer. Because of this, I decided that I wanted to make him seem a little scrappy. Someone who is not a perfect person, but decidedly good.
I also wanted to show how he worked hard to be a good racer and so instead of giving him a motorcycle I gave him a bike. Unlike his other competitors he couldn't afford a top of the line vehicle, he has to work hard with everything he's got every race. Not only does he have to work hard in his life as a racer, but also physically as he strains his body to push down on the pedals. 

The most expensive thing he owns is his helmet. I designed it after the Maneki-neko inspired by a comic I enjoy The Lucky Cat by The Lucky Cat Team, that combines both the story of The Zodiac and the Maneki-Neko. Where the cat in the Zodiac Race becomes the Lucky Cat.

This was the final design of my character as well as his helmet.

For my art class our final assignment was to take an already existing tale and reimagine the characters and enviroment within it.
We chose the myth of the Zodica Race and I reworked the character of the cat.
In certain versions of the Myth The cat is pushed into the water by the rat who wants to come in first place. This is the version we used.

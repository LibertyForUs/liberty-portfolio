For my art class our final assignment was to take an already existing tale and reimagine the characters and enviroment within it.
We chose the myth of the Zodica Race and I reworked the character of the cat.
In certain versions of the Myth The cat is pushed into the water by the rat who wants to come in first place. This is the version we used. 
We reimagined the Zodiac race as a street race taking place in a cyberpunk-esque future where animal people race in underground leagues for an attempt to join human racers in the premier leagues.



This was the final design of my character as well as his helmet.

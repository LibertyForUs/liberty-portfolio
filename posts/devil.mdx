People conceive of the Devil as charasmatic - the fallen angel Morningstar, the seducer, scratch at the crossroads or they think of him as a monster, the beast, legion, and so on.  

Here I wanted to create a Blender model of the Devil as a middle aged man.

Not charasmatic, not monstrous, just the master of hell, aging there.  I want my figure to feel heavy, fleshy, with subtle emotion.  What do you think about how I did?

In this storybuilding exercise I see the devil had attempted to usurp, fought, fell.  He built an empire in hell and reigned there for millenia.  

Eventually the Devil becomes disillusioned and tires of his rebellion.  He ascends up on top of his tallest tower.  He stands atop it gazing up.  There he can see the hole in the sky that he fell through.  Through it, he can glimpse heaven above.  He sees that sitting there, weeping, is an angel.  He sees that it is his brother, missing him.  Across the unfathomable distance, they make eye contact.  They both weep.  Nothing will change, the rebellion is forever as is their love.

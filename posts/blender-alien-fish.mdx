This year I am teaching myself how to use Blender.  I love it.  

I didn’t have any particular story in mind for this alien fish/scary mermaid.

I just wanted to make one so I did.

        width={1920} 
        height={1080}
      />


I ended up rigging it in Blender.  If I knew I was going to rig it I would’ve modeled it differently so that its large fins/wings would not be so curved and its tail would be straight down. 

Here you can see the rigging.

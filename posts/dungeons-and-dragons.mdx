Dungeons and Dragons is a great game and a great inspiration for me to make games.  I am especially interested in the narratives that emerge through world building and character development.  Most of my involvement in D&D has been in world building but lately I've been playing in others' campaigns and have been inspired to create charachters.  When I can I like to practice Blender by rendering aspects of those characters.

This duck is a spell from a dnd game that I am a player in.

My character Toag is an artificer which is like a magical engineer and has a giant mechanical duck called Lucky. Toag likes ducks because Toagâ€™s future child loves ducks.

One time the NPC the party saved was dying and so I casted cure wounds and the DM asked me to describe what my magic looked like. I described how out of my artificer tools little ducks formed made of metal and then became more lifelike as they waddled on. They wore little medical hats and helped cure the person.

The idea then stuck in my head of these adorable little medical ducks so I wanted to try 3D modeling one. 




I was especially proud of the medical hat because it was my first time attempting my texture through nodes in blender.
